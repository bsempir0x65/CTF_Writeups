This time we made it easy for us and just started doing something. So we mostly were able to solve the easy challenges but heh we had fun and thats the important part. ＠＾▽＾＠

As the first challenge we got a tar.gz package with 1000 files which seems on the first glance just to differ based on the name of the file. So we first ran
```console
└─$ md5sum *                                             
56f9fc5e1e5e02492fb9d5e7b8dbe13b  actf{look1ng_f0r_answers_in_the_p0uring_r4in_00b82a142fc1}.txt

56f9fc5e1e5e02492fb9d5e7b8dbe13b  actf{look1ng_f0r_answers_in_the_p0uring_r4in_0c24263013ad}.txt
56f9fc5e1e5e02492fb9d5e7b8dbe13b  actf{look1ng_f0r_answers_in_the_p0uring_r4in_0cb13db7de98}.txt
56f9fc5e1e5e02492fb9d5e7b8dbe13b  actf{look1ng_f0r_answers_in_the_p0uring_r4in_0cd4025ea71b}.txt
```
to see if they are really all the same. So since its 1000 files its to tedious to search for the one different file. Therefor we just grep out the ones which are already duplicates, which results in
```console
└─$ md5sum * | grep -v "56f9fc5e1e5e02492fb9d5e7b8dbe13b"
668cb9edd4cd2c7f5f66bee312bd1988  actf{look1ng_f0r_answers_in_the_p0uring_r4in_b21f9732f829}.txt
```
the one we were searching. Voila nice little challenge for the shell and our first points. (((o(*°▽°*)o)))
P.S: The solution commands were executed in the folder out of the unzipped tar file.

Based on the name and the fact that we get a pcap file its time to bring out wireshark or whatever package inspection tool you like. (o^ ^o)
Once uponed up with wireshark we can see that we have a quite short recording with 27 packages. So you could just search for actf as first part of each Flag which gives you:

 <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bsempir0x65/CTF_Writeups/main/AngstromCTF_2022/img/shark1_wire.png" alt="shark1_wire" width="50%" height="50%">

But this is too easy. We like to understand the conversation happening so we followed the TCP Stream:

 <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bsempir0x65/CTF_Writeups/main/AngstromCTF_2022/img/shark1_wire2.png" alt="shark1_wire2" width="50%" height="50%">

which gives us a way easier method to copy paste the flag (ｏ・_・)ノ”(ノ_<、).

# <a name="Shark2"></a>Shark2

 <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bsempir0x65/CTF_Writeups/main/AngstromCTF_2022/img/shark2.png" alt="shark2" width="50%" height="50%">

Followed by Shark1 we thought why not do Shark2 ? So we did. Again we got a pcap file to work with. So we used the follow TCP Stream method to see if something interesting comes up. Once we went trough the different streams we saw in tcp.stream 1 an interesting message.

 <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bsempir0x65/CTF_Writeups/main/AngstromCTF_2022/img/shark2_wire.png" alt="shark2_wire" width="50%" height="50%">

So we were pretty sure that the flag is hidden within the next TCP Stream. 

 <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bsempir0x65/CTF_Writeups/main/AngstromCTF_2022/img/shark2_wire2.png" alt="shark2_wire2" width="50%" height="50%">

So based on words like photoshop which is a image editing program we concluded that its probably a picture what was sent here. But when we checked if we can export the content of a HTTP connection wireshark said "no no there is nothing" (＃＞＜).
So we then googled the file header info a knew then that [JFIF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG_File_Interchange_Format) is actually something like a jpeg. So the easy way people probably used is just to export the TCP stream in raw format and pingo. But not us we are not so clever ヽ༼௵ل͜௵༽ﾉ.
What we did is used the tool foremost on the pcap file which found also this header in the pcap file and extracted for us the jpeg. Not sure why but the exported one is a bit glitchy so we have unique one.

Another one solved, good run !

Next we moved on and tried next a web challenge. For this challenge we got a website which shows us already the flag format with according to the text is not the right one. But we don't fall for such simple tricks and tried it on the angstrom website. Yeah it was wrong but you never know in times like this with all the misinformation's.
After a closer look we could see that a javascript file is responsible for quickly changing the context of the site and the hint in the exercise also suggest to watch a certain DOM object to get notified when it gets changed and you then can just print out the flag. Too easy.
So first lets have a look on this nice javascript:

```js
const _0x15c166 = _0x43fe;
(function (_0x20ab81, _0xdea176) {
  const _0x3bb316 = _0x43fe,
  _0x25fbaf = _0x20ab81();
  while (!![]) {
    try {
      const _0x58137d = - parseInt(_0x3bb316(212, 'H3tY')) / 1 + - parseInt(_0x3bb316(215, 'nwZz')) / 2 + parseInt(_0x3bb316(225, '%[Nl')) / 3 + parseInt(_0x3bb316(214, 'ub7C')) / 4 * ( - parseInt(_0x3bb316(231, '3RP4')) / 5) + parseInt(_0x3bb316(217, '9V4u')) / 6 + parseInt(_0x3bb316(223, 't*r!')) / 7 * (parseInt(_0x3bb316(207, 'SMMO')) / 8) + parseInt(_0x3bb316(226, '6%rI')) / 9 * (parseInt(_0x3bb316(230, '3RP4')) / 10);
      if (_0x58137d === _0xdea176) break;
       else _0x25fbaf['push'](_0x25fbaf['shift']());
    } catch (_0xa016d7) {

Yeah way to complex to deobfuscate it for an easy challenge. So based on the fact that i have bad Screen with some delays in the framerate why not just use that to make a video to see what the value would be ♡＾▽＾♡.

Just to make it easy for everyone we caught it right at 5 seconds so for mplayer it would be:

And for everyone who does not want to type it out: act{sp33dy_l1ke_th3_fl4sh} . That's not the intended way but way funnier.

So we were given a file that according to the creators does nothing. Instead of real reverse engineering we just started with the strings command to see if the flag is in plain text already present.

As you can see we were already lucky. We just needed to put these together and voila we had the flag actf{emhpaidmezerodollarstomakethischallenge_amogus}.
So this way was a bit to easy so we wanted to understand what happens and actually nothing happens. The program just loads the flag into the memory and then exits. As you can see here:

Again another little tool for us to challenge and once we have it we can check the solution on the server. So [binary ninja](https://cloud.binary.ninja/) as suggested does a great job but [ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/) were already booted:

 <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bsempir0x65/CTF_Writeups/main/AngstromCTF_2022/img/numbergame1.png" alt="numbergame1" width="50%" height="50%">

The static analysis does a great job and we can see what we need to do in order to get the flag for convenience here is the decompiled code with some comments:

```C

undefined8 main(void)

{
  int iVar1;
  undefined8 uVar2;
  size_t sVar3;
  char local_58 [72];
  int local_10; <- was unassigned as integer but based on the read_int() function call it was quite clear it had to be an int
  int local_c; <- was unassigned as integer but based on the read_int() function call it was quite clear it had to be an int
  
  puts("Welcome to clam\'s number game!");
  printf("Step right up and guess your first number: ");
  fflush(stdout);
  local_c = read_int();
  if (local_c == 314159265) { <- we know that local_c is an int to this is an int check and we can convert the hex value in an int
    printf("That\'s great, but can you follow it up? ");
    fflush(stdout);
    local_10 = read_int();
    if (local_10 + local_c == 513371337) { <- we know that local_10 + local_c is an int to this is an int check and we can convert the hex value in an int
      puts("That was the easy part. Now, what\'s the 42nd number of the Maltese alphabet?");
      getchar();
      fgets(local_58,0x40,stdin); <- takes our input
      sVar3 = strcspn(local_58,"\n"); <- cuts out the \n when we click enter 
      local_58[sVar3] = '\0';
      iVar1 = strcmp(local_58,"the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow"); <- is the string it compares to as the last solution
      if (iVar1 == 0) {
        puts("How... how did you get that? That reference doesn\'t even make sense...");
        puts("Whatever, you can have your flag I guess.");
        print_flag();
        uVar2 = 0;
      }
      else {
        puts("Ha! I knew I would get you there!");
        uVar2 = 1;
      }
    }
    else {
      puts("Sorry but you didn\'t win :(");
      uVar2 = 1;
    }
  }
  else {
    puts("Sorry but you didn\'t win :(");
    uVar2 = 1;
  }
  return uVar2;
}
```
Based on the comments above we concluded the following entry's in order for the flag:

1. 314159265 first number
2. 314159265 + x = 513371337 -> x = 199212072 second number
3. "the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow" third number without quotes

Which brings us
```console
└─$ nc challs.actf.co 31334
Welcome to clam's number game!
Step right up and guess your first number: 314159265
