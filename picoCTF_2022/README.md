We have read multiple times that a good start for any beginner would be the picoCTF. We missed the last one and yes there is the gym with all the task which is create but a small challenge is also a nice carrot on a stick. So we made the one or the other challenge and were happy that most of it were not an issue for us. The ones which were interesting enough we also made a small write up to remember what we did.

In this challenge we were given a binary with the task to get the flag with no further hints. Since we used already several tools in other CTFs we started to try out a new one. Many times people used radare2 for example but this time we tried the gui version Cutter. Luckily we also saw that kali has an package for that. So after a quick apt install we were about to start Cutter.
